         <p>There are a few professions out there that let you build and create and show your skills. For me, it is the world of construction. My goal is to graduate from California State University East Bay with a Bachelor's Degree of construction management. The construction industry lets me create things, build, and coordinate something from the beginning to the end.
         <br>
         <br>
         To be a successful construction manager, you need to be someone who enjoys working in a construction atmosphere. You should feel confident in managing employees who operate large pieces of machinery and be able to explain the benefits of your project to potential investors. Construction managers are good sales people, they need to be able to persuade investors. I am a great sales person because I have experience, I have worked at a store selling people clothes and giving customer service for 3 years, They also have strong accounting skills, which is a skill that I have as well, I have always gotten good grades in all of my math classes. My mom calculates all of the paychecks for the staff of the store she owns. When I turned 12, she gave that job to me and I have not made a mistake to this day.
         <br>
         <br>
         All of my experiences have taught me many things about myself.  I have learned how important it is to double check your work and I have also learned how to persuade people. Overall, I hope to achieve my goals and accomplish everything I have planned for myself.  Thank you for your deliberation.

         During the COVID-19 Pandemic, I learned how to make a retail website. Over the course of 1-2 months, I constructed a fully-functional retail website from scratch with a full payment system. It was a learing experience and I got familiar with JavaScript too. In all, I felt like it was a fun time.
